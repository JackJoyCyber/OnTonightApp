Subject: Make your regulars visible — OnTonight (pilot)

Hi <Manager/Owner Name>,

We help venues highlight the people guests come back for. OnTonight turns your best staff into a magnet for regulars — simple, tasteful, and free for select venues during pilot launch in Tampa.

Setup takes ~20 minutes. We provide the assets; you get a clean summary of engagement and (most importantly) more repeat visits.

Interested in a 30–60 day pilot?
